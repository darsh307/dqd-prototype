# Duplicate Question Detection Prototype
1) Backend: Python Programming
2) Dataset: Quora dataset from kaggle
3) Dataset Link - https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs

**Proposed System:**
To develop a prediction model to find out whether the entered pair of questions are a duplicate or not. This use-case helps websites like Quora and StackOverflow to effectively eliminate duplicate questions from their site, and provides a clean User Interface. Quora dataset from kaggle is used. Random forest classifier and XGB classifier algorithms are used to compare the accuracy percentage.

**Implementation performed:**
1) Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) is done for the dataset.
2) Bag of words (BOW) method is used to perform NLP.
3) Basic features are introduced to the original dataset reaching the total feature count to 13.
4) Accuracy is determined using Random forest & XGB Classifier.

**Expected future implemention:**
1) Add more features to enhance the analysing process.
2) Pre-processing needs to be done like removing stopwords, replacing special characters, replacing numbers, distracting words etc.
3) A user interface can be created so that 2 questions can be taken as input and provides output if it is a duplicate or not duplicate.
